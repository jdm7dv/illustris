Logon to DB2 Wire Protocol Dialog Box

IP ADDRESS: Type the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the machine where the catalog tables are stored. Specify the address using the machine's numeric address (for example, 123.456.78.90) or specify 
its host name. If you enter a host name, the driver must find this 
name (with the correct address assignment) in the HOSTS file on 
the workstation or in a DNS server.

TCP PORT: Type the port number that is assigned to the DB2 server 
on the machine where the catalog tables are stored. Specify either 
this port's numeric address or its service name (5179 is the 
default port address). If you specify a service name, the driver 
must find this name (with the correct port assignment) in the 
SERVICES file on the workstation.

LOCATION: If you are running DB2 on OS/390 or AS/400, type the DB2 location name. Use the name defined during the local DB2 
installation.

COLLECTION: If you are running DB2 on OS/390 or AS/400, type the 
name that identifies a group of packages. These packages include 
the Connect ODBC for DB2 Wire Protocol driver packages. The 
default is DATADIRECT00.

DATABASE NAME: If you are running DB2 on Windows NT or UNIX, type 
the name of the remote database that you want to access. You must 
have cataloged any database that you wish to access from the 
client.

USER NAME: If required, type your user name (logon ID).

PASSWORD: If required, type your password.
