# description: This script is used to start and stop the IDL dicomex \
#              storage scp service.
#
# To use it, you might have to customize it for your site.
# The shell variables ITT_DIR and IDL_DIR set set by the installer.
#
# The dicomex storage scp software does not require root privileges
# to operate.  The license management daemons should be started
# by a non-privileged user with a restrictive umask setting, preventing
# the unneccessary use of the root account.  The dicomex storage scp
# can be started by a non-privileged user by modifying the start
# command from below as follows:
#    "start") su username -c "umask 022;$IDL_DIR/bin/idl_dicomexstorscp &"
# where "username" is the account name of an unprivileged user that has
# execute permission for the dicomex storage scp, write permission for
#  the log file.
#
# Once this file is properly customized, use the following commands to
# install it on your system. These commands assume that your current working
# directory is the one containing this script.  Make sure to use the
# appropriate commands for your system. Alternatively, you can use the
# "dicomexstorscp_install" script, located in this directory.
## 
# Sun Solaris, Linux 
# -------------------------------
#	% cp sys5_idl_dicomexstorscp /etc/init.d
#	% ln /etc/init.d/sys5_idl_dicomexstorscp /etc/rc3.d/S99sys5_idl_dicomexstorscp
#	% ln /etc/init.d/sys5_idl_dicomexstorscp /etc/rc0.d/K01sys5_idl_dicomexstorscp
#
# Darwin (Mac OS X)
# -----------------
#	Please consult the 'dicomexstorscp_install" script for instructions.
#
# After executing these commands, reboot the system.
#
# The following steps explain the commands above.
#
#	1) Copy this script to the standard System V location.
#	2) Link it into the run level 2 directory.
#          The leading 'S' means that our daemon should be started
#          at run level 2. The 99 causes this script
#	   to be executed after all other scripts in the rc directory.
#	3) Link it into the run level 0 directory. The leading 'K' means
#	   that our daemon should be killed when entering run level 0. 
#	   The 01 causes this script to be executed 
#	   before the other scripts in /etc/rc0.d.
#	4) Reboot the system, returning to multi-user mode. Entering this
#	   mode will cause the IDL dicomex storage scp daemon to be started.
#
# TO LEARN MORE:
#	- Read about run levels in the System Administration guide for
#	  your system.
#	- Read the file /etc/init.d/README or /sbin/init.d/README or
#         read the manual pages for init, rc0, rc1, rc2, and rc3.
