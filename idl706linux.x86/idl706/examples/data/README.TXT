This directory contains data files used by IDL example code
included in the IDL distribution tree. Data files used by
documentation examples are also located in this directory.

Files in this directory use a variety of data formats.
In general, files with the extension ".dat" are either IDL
SAVE/RESTORE files or pure binary data. Files with extensions
".tif", ".png", etc. are image files in the format specified
by the extension.

Consult the file index.txt for a listing of the data files
in this directory, including the type of image, image size,
and format.
