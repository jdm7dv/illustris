;  Create a data array.

X = FLTARR(256)	

; Make a step function. Array elements 80 through 120 are set to 1.

X(80:120) = 1	

; Make a filter.

FREQ = FINDGEN(256)

; Make the filter symmetrical about the value x =128.

FREQ = FREQ < (256-FREQ)

; The filter is a second order Butterworth filter,
; with a cutoff frequency = 20.

FIL = 1./(1+(FREQ/20)^2)

; Plot with a logarithmic x-axis. Use exact axis range.
