          WELCOME TO THE MINIMIZATION DEMO



   Optimization algorithms search and find the        
   minimum of a function using iteration. Depending on
   the function, a particular algorithm may converge 
   faster than another. An algorithm may not converge
   at all in certain circumstances, where another 
   will.

   This demo shows two methods : the 
   Donovan-Fletcher-Powell (DFP) and the Powell.


   MENU OPTIONS
   ------------

   File Menu:
      Select "Quit" to exit the Minimization Demo and 
      return to the main IDL Demo screen.

   About Menu:
      Select "About minimization" for information 
      about the Minimization Demo.

   FEATURES
   --------

   <<Select a Surface>> button
      Select one of three different surfaces. These 
      surfaces are used for testing minimization
      algorithms because they are known to produce
      cases that exceed the bounds of the algorithms.

   <<Select a Starting Point>> button
      Select one of four different starting points.

   <<Find Minimum>> button
      Activated only after a starting point has been
      specified, the sequence will compute and 
      display how the 2 algorithms find the minimum.

   <<Reset surface>> button
      Reset the selected surface to display the 
      four starting points on the initial surface.

   <<Results>>
      Displays the location of the minimum and the 
      number of iterations that were necessary.
