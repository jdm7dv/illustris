        WELCOME TO THE 2-D PLOTTING DEMO


This demonstration shows six types of two dimensional
(X versus Y) plot. The types are:
  
   1) Line plot

   2) Scatter plot with symbols

   3) Histogram (Bar plot)

   4) Polar plot

   5) Log-log plot

   6) Semi-log plot

FEATURES OF THE 2-D PLOTTING DEMO
-----------------------------------

In this demo, different controls appear on the
interface when different types of plots are selected.
The data plotted is generated automatically by the
demo application; you can generate new data by clicking
the "Generate New Data" button.

Select a plot type from the set of radio buttons
at the top left of the demo window.

Line Plot
    Display an X versus Y plot of a damped sine wave.
    NOTE: you cannot change the data set for the Line
    Plot display.

    <<Period slider>>
    Adjust this slider to change the period of the
    sinusoidal signal.

Scatter plot with symbols
    Display the generated data set using symbols.

    <<Variance slider>>
    Generate a new data set of random values added to
    a sine function.  The variance of the random signal
    is set by the slider.

    <<Symbols scrolling list>>
    Select a symbol to be plotted at the data points
    from the scrolling list.

Histogram (Bar plot)
    Display a histogram, or "bar" plot.

    <<Variance slider>>
    Generate a new data set of random values added to a
    sine function.  The variance of the random signal is
    set by the slider.

Polar plot
    Display a polar plot. The data coordinates are given
    in spherical coordinates.

    <<Color scrolling list>>
    Select a color for the plot line from the list.

           
Log-log plot
    Display a log-log plot.

    <<Thickness slider>>
    Adjust this slider to change the line thickness.
    Line thicknesses range from 1 to 5.

Semi-log plot
    Display a semi-log plot.

    <<X slider>>
    Change the X position of the text annotation.

    <<Y slider>>
    Change the Y position of the text annotation.


<<Generate New Data Button>>
     Click this button to generate a new data set for
     display in the plotting window.
