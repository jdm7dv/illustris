          WELCOME TO ORBITING SATELLITE DEMO

   
This demo shows a satellite in orbit around the
Earth.
   
The objects (Earth and satellite) are subject
to 3 fundamental operations:
  
   1) Scaling       :  The size of the satellite
                       can be scaled.
 
   2) Translation   :  The satellite position 
		       changes over time.

   3) Rotation      :  The Earth, clouds, and the
		       satellite all rotate. Notice
		       that the rotation rate of
		       the clouds is greater than
		       of the Earth.

The satellite's orbit parameters at the epoch
time are:

semi-major axis             :  9200  km
eccentricity                :  0.3
inclination                 :  75.0  degrees
mean anomaly                :  38.0  degrees
longitude of ascending node :  64.0  degrees
argument of perigee         :  28.0  degrees


You can rotate the entire image by positioning the mouse
in the draw widget, holding down the left mouse button,
and dragging the mouse.

FEATURES OF THE ORBITING SATELLITE DEMO
---------------------------------------

<<Start button>>
    Start the animation.

<<Stop button>>
    Stop the animation.

<<Reset button>>
    Reset the initial orientation of the satellite
    and the earth.

<<Scaling slider>>
    Adjust the slider to scale the size of the satellite
    in the range 0.75 to 1.25.

<<Animation step slider>>
    Adjust the slider to control the size of the "steps"
    the satellite takes in its orbit. A smaller value for
    the step means the satellite moves less distance with
    each translation, resulting in a smoother animation.

    LEFT MOUSE BUTTON

        Click-drag-release will rotate the
        whole view.
