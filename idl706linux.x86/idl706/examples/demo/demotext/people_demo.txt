5		Warping and Morphing Demo

This demo illustrates image warping, morphing (the
gradual changing of one image to another), and image
compression using IDL.  Images of several employees
are used to demonstrate the features.

The pictures are stored in JPEG compressed image format,
which is fully supported by IDL. Each 192 by 192 image
(36K bytes) is stored using JPEG in less than 6K bytes,
resulting in approximately 6 to 1 compression.

To experiment with image warping, first display a picture,
then click the "Warping" button.  The warping control box
should become visible on the right side of the demo widget.

Control or "tie" points are used to specify how the image
is to be warped.  Each control point in the original image
is transformed to a designated point in the "warped" output
image. To make a control point, position the cursor over the
image, click the left mouse button, and drag the cursor to
the place where that point should appear in the warped image.
IDL will draw an arrow with the base at the control point's
original position, and the head at the "warped" position. 
At least three control points must be defined to warp an
image.  Up to 100 control points may be defined.

To make a control point with the same position in both the
original and output image, click the left mouse button at
that point. This has the effect of fixing that point at
the same location in both images.

Note: the output image is only defined over the convex
hull of the control points. To include the entire image,
use the "Mark Corners" button.

FEATURES OF THE WARPING AND MORPHING DEMO
----------------------------------

<<Warping button>>
    Click this button to set the application to the warping
    mode. This functionality is available when the image of
    only one person is displayed.

<<Morphing button>>
    Click this button to set the application to the morphing
    mode. This functionality is available when the image of
    everyone is displayed.

<<Group button>>
    Click this button to display an image of four employees.

<<People list>>
    Select a name from the list to display the image
    of the selected person.
    
  
WARPING MODE FEATURES
---------------------

<<Undo button>>
    Click this button to remove the most recently defined
    control point.  

<<Reset button>>
    Click this button to display the original image (one
    person) and clear the control points.

<<Warp Linear button>>
    Click this button to set the warping function to linear.
    Display the warped image if 3 or more control points are
    defined.

<<Warp Smooth button>>
    Click this button to set the warping function to smooth.
    Display the warped image if 3 or more control points are
    defined.

<<Original button>>
    Click this button to display the original image (one
    person). The arrows connecting the control points are
    shown.

<<Surface>>
    Click this button to display the warping X and Y
    deformation surface function.

<<Animate button>>
    Click this button to display an animation tool that
    illustrates the intermediate images between the original
    image and the final warped image.

<<Mark Corners on button>>
    Click this button to place four control points in the corners
    of the image. This fixes the corners of the output image to
    the same positions.


MORPHING MODE FEATURES
----------------------

<<Done button>>
    Click this button to exit the morphing demo.

<<Help button>>
    Click this button to display a help file that explains
    how to operate the morphing demo (not this file).

<<Restart button>>
    Click this button to reset the morphing procedure to
    the beginning.

<<Delete CP button>>
    Click this button to delete all the control points.
 
<<Go button>>
    Click this button to display an animation tool that shows
    the images as they morph from one to the other.

<<Frames droplist>>
    Select the number of images to be created as intermediate
    steps in the morphing process. The larger the number of
    images used, the smoother the morph will look, and that
    longer the process will take.
