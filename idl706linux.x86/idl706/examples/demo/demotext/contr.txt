        WELCOME TO THE CONTOUR DEMO

   This application shows IDL contouring
   capabilities.

   MENU OPTIONS
   ------------

   File Menu:
       Select Quit to exit the Contour demo and
       return to the IDL Demo main screen.

   About Menu:
       Select "About contours" for information
       about the Contour plot demo.


   DATASETS
   --------

   <<World Elevation>>
       Select this dataset to see examples of IDL's
       direct graphics contouring.

   <<Terrain Elevation>>
   <<Vehicle Tire>>
       Select these datasets to see examples of IDL's
       object graphics contouring.


   WORLD ELEVATION CONTROLS 
   ------------------------

   <<Number of levels>> slider
       Select the number of contour levels. You can
       choose 7, 11, or 15 levels.  This slider's
       numerical readout indicates the number of
       bands delimited by contour lines.  For
       example, with the slider at "7", and the
       "Colored Lines" checkbox selected, you will
       see contour lines at 6 elevations,
       delimiting 7 bands of elevation.

   <<Basic>> checkbox
       Displays the contour lines with solid white
       lines.

   <<Colored lines>> checkbox
       Displays the contour lines with solid lines
       in different colors.

   <<Fill>> checkbox
       Fills the areas between the contour lines
       with different colors.

   <<Linestyle>> checkbox
       Displays the contour lines with various
       linestyles.

   <<Annotation>> checkbox
       Annotates contour lines with their
       respective values. The "Number of levels"
       slider is disabled.

   <<Fill and lines>> checkbox
       Displays a filled contour plot with the
       contour lines shown as solid white lines.

   TERRAIN ELEVATION CONTROLS
   --------------------------
   <<Number of levels>> slider
       Select the number of levels.  This slider's
       numerical readout indicates the number of
       bands delimited by contour lines.  For
       example, with the slider at "3", and the
       "Contour Lines" checkbox selected, you will
       see contour lines at two elevations,
       delimiting three bands of elevation.

   <<Lines>> checkbox
       Displays contour lines on top of a texture
       mapped surface.

   <<Fill>> checkbox
       Displays 3-D filled contours.

   Right-clicking on the terrain surface:

       When line contours are displayed, you can
       select custom contour levels by
       right-clicking on the terrain surface.  (If
       you only have one mouse-button, and you are
       on a Macintosh computer, hold down the
       Command key while pressing the mouse button
       to simulate a "right" mouse-button press.)

   VEHICLE TIRE CONTROLS
   --------------------------
   <<Contour Lines>> checkbox
       Displays color contour lines in 3D.  The
       values being contoured represent percent
       change in distance from a the center of the
       tire.  A non-deformed tire is the baseline
       against which percentages are calculated.

   <<Filled Contours>> checkbox
       Displays filled color contours.

   <<Mesh>> checkbox
       Displays the geometry of the tire as a wire
       mesh, without contours.

   <<Colored Mesh>> checkbox
       Displays the geometry of the tire as a
       vertex-colored mesh, without contours.

   <<Surface>> checkbox
       Displays the geometry or the tire as filled
       polygons, without contours.

   <<Colored Surface>> checkbox
       Displays the geometry of the tire as filled
       polygons with colored vertices.  No contour
       object is displayed.

   <<Mesh and Contours>> checkbox
       Displays the geometry of the tire as a wire
       mesh, and displays color contour lines.

   <<Deformation Parameter>> slider
       Move this slider to change the amount of
       deformation applied to the tire.
