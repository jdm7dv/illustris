   available in IDL.

   FEATURES OF THE WIDGET DEMO
   ---------------------------

   The following widgets are included in the widget
   demo application:
       
   <<Style Droplist>>
       Select "Shaded", "Wire", or "Lego solid" from
       the list to change the appearance of the surface
       displayed in the draw widget.

   <<Surface Color List>>
       Select an item in the list to change the color
       of the surface displayed in the draw widget.
       The "Texture Map" option displays an image
       draped on the surface using the TEXTURE_MAP
       property of the surface.  The color values of
       the image are based on the data value of the
       surface and a color table.

   <<Rotation Sliders>>
       Change the position of the sliders to rotate the
       surface displayed in the draw widget around any
       one of the three axes.  Note that the surface
       can also be rotated by dragging the left mouse
       button within the draw widget.

   <<Editable Text Widget>>
       Click in the text field and use normal editing
       procedures to change the text.

   <<Message Popup Button>>
       Click on the "Message Popup" button to display a
       modal dialog message window. Click "OK" to dismiss
       the dialog.

   <<Table Widget>>
       The table widget displays the values of each
       element in the data array that is rendered in
       the draw widget.

       You can edit the values in the table widget by
       clicking in a table cell, deleting the existing
       value, and entering a new value.  Notice how
       the surface displayed in the draw widget
       changes as you alter values in the draw widget.

   <<Draw Widget>>
       A shaded surface rendering of the data shown in
       the table widget is displayed in the draw widget.
       Most of the widget controls discussed above affect
       the look of the displayed surface. In addition,
       you can rotate the surface directly by positioning
       the mouse in the draw widget, holding down the left
       mouse button, and dragging the mouse. Notice that
       the values of the rotation sliders are updated as
       you rotate the surface interactively.
