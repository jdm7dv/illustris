      There is no <i>exact match</i> for this topic in the IDL
      Online Help system. To find help on your topic, try one or more
      of the following:
      </FONT></P>
      <UL>
         <LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">

         Use the IDL Online Help viewer's <b>Index</b> tab. The
         index should already be displaying the index entry that most
         closely matches the text you entered.</LI>
         <LI>Use the IDL Online Help viewer's <b>Search</b> tab. The
         search feature allows you to search the text of the entire
         IDL Online Help system.</LI>
         <LI>Try a new search term.</LI>
      </UL>

            sans-serif" SIZE="3">Why Didn't the Help Viewer Find My Topic?
      </FONT></H2>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">
      The fact that the IDL Online Help system did not find an
      <i>exact match</i> for your search term does not mean that no
      information on your topic is available. When you specify a help
      topic, IDL first checks to see if the string you entered
      <i>exactly</i> matches the name of a top-level help topic.
      (Well, not quite <i>exactly</i>; case is ignored and some
      characters that might occur in the topic title are replaced.)
      If a match is found, the topic is displayed. If no exact match
      is found, IDL searches the <i>index</i> of the online help system
      for an <i>single</i> entry that exactly matches your search term.
      If match is found, the topic is displayed. If no match is found
      during either of these searches, or if your search term
      corresponds to more than one topic in the index, you see this
      message.
