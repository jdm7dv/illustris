This directory contains resource files used by the IDL DataMiner
option. There should be a subdirectory named after your
computer platform (i.e. "solaris2.sparc" for a Sun Sparc
computer running Solaris), which contains a copy of the
odbc.ini file used by your system.

Consult the IDL DataMiner Guide for details on the odbc.ini file.
