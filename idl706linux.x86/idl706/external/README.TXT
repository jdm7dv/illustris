------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains information related to using IDL
in conjunction with other programming languages. It contains
the following subdirectories:

  - activex (Windows Only)
    The activex directory contains information and files
    demonstrating how to create applications in Microsoft Windows
    development environments using the IDL ActiveX control.

  - callable
    The callable directory contains information and files
    necessary to create applications (in languages other
    than IDL) that call IDL as a library.

  - call_external
    The call_external directory contains information and files
    necessary to create applications (in languages other
    than IDL) which are then used by IDL either via CALL_EXTERNAL.

  - dlm
    This dlm directory contains information and files necessary
    to build the TESTMODULE dynamically loadable module (DLM).

  - rpc (Unix Only)
    The rpc directory contains information and files
    necessary to use IDL as a server for Remote Procedure
    Calls (RPCs). Note that RPCs are only available under
    Unix.

  - widstub (Unix Only)
    The widstub directory contains information and files
    necessary to create widgets (using the IDL function
    WIDGET_STUB) that can be used by IDL.
